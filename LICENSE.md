- Compile or build the Source Code into Binaries (typically .jar files) on their personal computing devices
- Use compiled Binaries resulting from personal compilation for personal use exclusively

This permission is granted with the understanding that such Binaries are for the sole benefit of the compiling user and may not be distributed, shared, or made available to any other party.

### 3.2 Personal Use Definition and Restrictions

For purposes of this License, "Personal Use" is defined as:

- After donating for **2 (two) Mods**, all remaining Mods developed by Licensor **that are released under this License** are automatically covered at no additional cost
- A Content Creator who donates for any 2 Mods receives the attribution waiver and perpetual license for all other Mods **released under this License** in Licensor's catalog
- This "2-Mod Cap" incentivizes early support while providing complete freedom for broader Mod usage

Subscriber/follower counts are determined by the Content Creator's primary platform (YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, etc.) at the time of donation.

#### 12.2.1.1 Custom SMP (Survival Multiplayer) Pricing

Content Creator groups or networks running Custom Survival Multiplayer (SMP) servers may utilize Licensor's Mods under a flat-rate seasonal licensing model:

**Custom SMP Licensing Terms:**

- **One-Time Seasonal Fee**: $20 USD per SMP season
- **Coverage**: The $20 seasonal fee covers all members, contributors, and participants of the SMP project
- **Duration**: Licensing is valid for the specified season of the SMP (defined by the SMP organizers)
- **Multiple Mods**: The $20 seasonal fee covers unlimited use of any and all Mods developed by Licensor **released under this License** for that season
- **Attribution**: Standard attribution requirements apply unless waived by direct written permission from Licensor

**Custom SMP Licensing Process:**

- The SMP organizer or lead Content Creator contacts Licensor to register the SMP project
- Licensor confirms the SMP scope, expected duration, and participating creators
- Upon payment of the $20 seasonal fee, all team members are authorized to use any Licensor Mods in SMP content for that season
- At the end of the season or renewal, a new seasonal fee is required if continued use is desired

This model prevents per-creator fees for team-based content and supports collaborative SMP projects.

#### 12.2.2 Single Donation Requirement

- **One (1) minimum donation is required per Mod per Content Creator** (if choosing to donate) to waive attribution requirements and licensing restrictions
- This single donation grants perpetual, ongoing rights to use the Mod in content creation without additional licensing fees, recurring payments, or renewal requirements
- A Content Creator making a single donation at the required tier level establishes a permanent relationship and is not required to donate again

#### 12.2.3 Donation Channels

Donations may be submitted through official Licensor channels, including but not limited to:

- Ko-fi (ko-fi.com)
- Patreon (patreon.com)
- Other official donation platforms designated by Licensor

#### 12.2.4 Donor Recognition

All donors who provide support through official donation channels will be recognized and credited in a dedicated **DONORS.md** file maintained in each Mod's official repository. The DONORS.md file shall list:

- Donor names or usernames (as provided by the donor)
- Donation amount or tier (if applicable)
- Date of donation
- Optional public message or comment from the donor
- Content Creator channel/platform (if applicable)

Donors may request to remain anonymous or to have their information removed from the DONORS.md file at any time by contacting Licensor.

#### 12.2.5 Attribution Waiver and Perpetual License via Donation

Content Creators who provide a minimum donation through official donation channels receive:

- **Per-Mod Coverage**: Each donation covers one (1) specific Mod for which the donation was made
- **Auto-Waiver After 2 Mods**: Upon donating for any 2 Mods, all remaining Mods developed by Licensor are automatically covered without additional payment
- **Attribution Waiver**: Complete waiver of all attribution requirements under Section 13 for the Mod(s) and Mods covered by this tier
- **Perpetual License**: Unlimited, perpetual right to use covered Mods in monetized content creation, streaming, and derivative works without additional licensing fees, renewal requirements, or future payments
- **No Recurring Costs**: Each donation establishes a permanent license for that Mod; Content Creators are never required to donate again for covered Mods or pay additional fees for continued use
- **Coverage**: The donation(s) cover use of the Content Creator's channel or brand in all content, across all platforms, indefinitely

**Example Scenario:**
A Content Creator with 75,000 subscribers donates $20 for Mod A and $20 for Mod B. They have now satisfied the 2-Mod cap and automatically gain the attribution waiver and perpetual license for Mods C, D, E, and all other Licensor Mods without additional payment.

#### 12.2.5.1 SMP Donation Coverage

For Custom SMP projects that have paid the seasonal fee:

- All participating Content Creators and team members automatically receive the same attribution waiver and perpetual license benefits as standard donors
- The $20 seasonal fee covers unlimited Mod usage **for all Mods released under this License** for all team members for the season
- No individual Content Creator needs to make separate donations if the SMP has paid the seasonal licensing fee

#### 12.2.6 Alternative to Donation: Written Permission Request

Content Creators who do **not wish to donate** may instead contact Licensor directly to request written permission to waive attribution requirements. This alternative path is **completely voluntary** and available to all Content Creators regardless of audience size or monetization status.

- Content Creators may request permission by contacting Licensor (contact information in Section 15)
- Licensor will review the request and provide written authorization if approved
- Upon approval, Content Creators receive the same attribution waiver as donors
- No payment or donation is required for this pathway
- Licensor's decision to approve or deny requests is at its sole discretion

#### 12.2.7 Verification and Audience Size Updates

- Content Creators must accurately report their subscriber/follower count at the time of donation
- If a Content Creator's audience size increases significantly, they are encouraged (but not required) to increase their donation tier; increased donations are voluntary and not mandatory
- Licensor reserves the right to request reasonable proof of audience size (public channel statistics) if donation tier is disputed

#### 12.2.7 Non-Monetized Creators

Content Creators who produce non-monetized content (no ads, sponsorships, or revenue generation) are **not required** to donate and may use Mods freely under standard attribution requirements in Section 13.

### 12.3 Monetization and Commercial Use Prohibition

Notwithstanding the free distribution of Mods, users may **NOT**:

- Charge fees for access to, download of, or use of any Mod
- Include Mods in paid software bundles, premium services, or subscription offerings
- Sell modified versions of Mods or claim ownership of Mod content
- Use Mods as the primary product in a commercial venture

The free nature of the Mods is fundamental to this License and may not be circumvented.

The attribution and disclosure requirements in this section apply specifically to Content Creators whose use of Mods falls outside the scope of Personal Use as defined in Section 3.2.

### 13.2 Definition of Content Creator and Monetized Content

For purposes of this License:

- **"Content Creator"**: Any individual or entity who creates, produces, or distributes video, stream, podcast, or other media content featuring one or more Mods.
- **"Monetized Content"**: Any content creation or streaming activity where the creator receives any form of compensation, revenue, sponsorship, or financial benefit, whether directly from viewers/platforms (ads, subscriptions) or indirectly (sponsorships, donations, brand deals).

Personal gameplay recordings, non-monetized educational videos, and private streaming are not considered monetized content for purposes of this section.

### 13.3 Attribution Requirements for Monetized Content

Content Creators who produce monetized content featuring Mods released by Licensor must provide clear attribution as follows:

**Waiver 3 - Non-Marked Extension Mods in Modpacks**: If a Mod is used as an extension or dependency (through documented Extension API) within a public modpack, and the Mod is **NOT** marked as a Library Mod, the Content Creator may provide attribution to the modpack rather than the individual Mod, provided:

- The public modpack project page is clearly linked
- The modpack includes proper documentation listing all included Mods
- Viewers can discover the individual Mod through the modpack documentation

**Waiver 4 - Direct Permission**: Content Creators may request written permission from Licensor to use a Mod in monetized content without providing standard attribution. Licensor may grant such permission at its sole discretion. Contact information is provided in Section 15.

### 13.4 Mod Usage Disclosure

Regardless of attribution requirements, Content Creators are strongly encouraged to disclose which Mods they are using in their content so that viewers:

- Know which Mods enhance the gameplay experience
- Can attempt to recreate the setup shown in the content
- Have the opportunity to download and use the Mods themselves

This disclosure supports community engagement and Mod discoverability.

### 13.5 Content Creator Rights and Speech

- Statements should be accurate and not deliberately misleading
- Feedback should be constructive and respectful when possible
- Content Creators may face community backlash or loss of credibility for dishonest or inflammatory content (but this is a consequence of community response, not Licensor enforcement)

### 13.5.3 No Retaliation or Censorship

Licensor commits to:

- Never taking legal action against a Content Creator solely for criticism or negative opinions
- Never filing copyright strikes, DMCA takedowns, or complaints to platforms based on criticism
- Never revoking a Content Creator's rights to use the Mods based on criticism
- Never engaging in harassment or coordinated attacks in response to criticism

Disagreement with criticism does not constitute grounds for action under this License.

### 13.6 No Claim to Content Creator Revenue

Licensor explicitly states:

- Content Creators retain all revenue, donations, sponsorships, and monetary compensation generated from their content
- Licensor makes no claim to Content Creator earnings or monetization
- Content Creator sponsorships with other brands do not require Licensor approval or notification
- Licensor will not contact platforms to request revenue sharing or compensation for Mod usage in content

Mods are provided free of charge with the understanding that Content Creators may generate revenue through their content creation activities. This is not a conflict with the free distribution of the Mods.

### 13.7 Content Creator Responsibility

Content Creators remain responsible for:

- Ensuring they have appropriate licensing and permissions for all other content, backgrounds, and assets used alongside Mods
- Complying with platform-specific rules and guidelines (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)
- Disclosing any sponsorships or paid partnerships as required by law and platform policy
- Providing accurate information about Mod functionality and features

## 14. Clopen License Model and Philosophy

### 12.1 Explanation of "Clopen"

This License follows a "Clopen" (Closed-Open Hybrid) model that balances the benefits of open-source development with necessary protections against unauthorized commercial exploitation and derivative works. Under this model:

- **Open Elements**: Source Code is publicly accessible for viewing, study, learning, and contribution. Users may compile Source Code for personal use. The community is actively encouraged to develop extensions through documented APIs.
- **Closed Elements**: Source Code reuse in other projects is strictly prohibited. Unauthorized porting and secondary distribution are not permitted. The core intellectual property and design remain protected.

### 14.2 Rationale

Licensor has adopted this model to:

- Maintain transparency and foster community trust and involvement
- Enable educational access to the codebase for learning and understanding
- Protect against unauthorized commercial exploitation
- Prevent fragmentation caused by unauthorized ports and derivative distributions
- Maintain quality and security control of official distributions
- Encourage community contributions through transparent review and proper attribution

### 14.3 Philosophy

Licensor believes that open access to source code enhances community understanding and engagement while protective restrictions ensure the integrity, stability, and single source of truth for the Mods. This balanced approach serves the best interests of both the community and the project's long-term sustainability.

## 15. Intellectual Property Rights

### 13.1 Ownership

Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in the Mods, including all intellectual property rights such as copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. Nothing in this License transfers ownership of any intellectual property rights to any third party.

Intellectual property protections apply to:

- All Source Code and compiled Binaries
- Mod names, logos, branding, and visual designs
- Documentation and user guides
- Underlying algorithms, methodologies, and architectural approaches

### 13.3 User-Generated Content

To the extent permitted by applicable law, users grant Licensor a perpetual, royalty-free license to use any feedback, suggestions, bug reports, or other user-generated content submitted to Licensor, without obligation to provide compensation or attribution.
